# vfashion-mini-ecommerce
VFashion is a multi-page mini e-commerce web application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This project demonstrates dynamic product rendering, category-based filtering, cart management, and client-side data persistence using LocalStorage.

The application fetches product data from an external API and dynamically displays products based on selected categories. Users can increase/decrease product quantity, add items to the cart, and view the total price calculation on the cart page.

This project focuses on core frontend development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous JavaScript (Fetch API), and state management using LocalStorage.
